                <h4>From the Groom(Oluwaseyi)</h4>
                <p>I wasn't expecting love that day just attending a friends traditional wedding. But then I saw her. There was something about her calm presence and gentle smile that stayed with me. One conversation led to another, and I knew this wasn't a coincidence. It was the start of something divine</p>
